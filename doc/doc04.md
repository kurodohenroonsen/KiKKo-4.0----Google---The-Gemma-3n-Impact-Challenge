# Document 4/10: The Alchemy of Honey - The Role of the AIs

**Title:** The Alchemy of Honey: The Symbiotic Partnership of AI Agents

**Objective:** To define the conceptual technical architecture of Kikko's on-device AI system, detailing the distinct responsibilities of the "Worker Bees" (ML Kit), the "AI Queen" (Gemma), and the "Bourdon" (the communicator and occasional tempter), and how they collaborate to create structured knowledge.

---

### **Core Philosophy: A Hive, Not a Monolith**

Kikko's intelligence is not a single, monolithic AI. It is a **symbiotic swarm** of specialized agents, each with a precise function. This approach mirrors a real beehive, where different bees perform different tasks for the good of the whole. This distributed, task-specific architecture is more efficient, more modular, and allows us to use the best tool for each job.

The process follows a clear pipeline: **Capture -> Initial Extraction (Worker Bees) -> Bourdon's Offer (Optional) -> Pure Pollen Processing (Worker Bees & Queen) / Opaque Data Acceptance -> User Validation -> Structuring.**

### **1. The Worker Bees: Specialists in Raw Data Extraction (ML Kit)**

The Worker Bees are the tireless, meticulous laborers of the Hive, the first to interact with the raw "pollen" brought back by the Forager. They are highly efficient, single-purpose models from Google's ML Kit, designed for fast and accurate on-device data extraction. They are tools for the Queen, but crucial to her work.

*   **Vision-Based Bees (from ML Kit Vision):**
    *   **The Oculist Bee (Text Recognition v2):** Reads every character of text from photos of labels, documents, and signs, supporting multiple languages.
    *   **The Scanner Bee (Barcode Scanning):** Instantly deciphers barcodes and QR codes from visual pollen.
    *   **The Face Bee (Face Detection, Face Mesh Detection):** Identifies faces and their intricate 3D meshes for personalized memory connections.
    *   **The Movement Bee (Pose Detection, Selfie Segmentation, Subject Segmentation):** Understands human posture, segmenting subjects from their background for richer contextual memories.
    *   **The Archivist Bee (Document Scanner):** Optimizes photos of documents for clean text extraction.
    *   **The Classifier Bee (Image Labeling - Base & Custom Models):** Labels objects and concepts within images.
    *   **The Tracker Bee (Object Detection & Tracking):** Identifies and tracks multiple objects within a visual scene.
    *   **The Scribe Bee (Digital Ink Recognition):** Converts handwritten notes into digital text.
*   **Natural Language-Based Bees (from ML Kit Natural Language):**
    *   **The Polyglot Bee (Language Identification):** Detects the language of text or speech.
    *   **The Translator Bee (Translation):** Translates text or speech into other languages (used for internal localization of schemas).
    *   **The Communicator Bee (Smart Reply):** Generates quick, contextually relevant short replies for simple text interactions.
    *   **The Identifier Bee (Entity Extraction):** Extracts basic entities (addresses, dates, names) from unstructured text.
    *   **The Summarizer Bee (Summarization):** Condenses long texts into shorter forms.
    *   **The Corrector Bee (Proofreading):** Identifies and corrects grammatical errors.
    *   **The Stylist Bee (Rewriting):** Rewrites text in different styles.
    *   **The Describer Bee (Image Description):** Generates natural language descriptions for images.

A glowing orb of 'pollen' (representing a captured photo of a complex object like a book with text and a barcode) floats inside the Hive. A diverse team of cute, specialized robot Worker Bees (ML Kit models) with unique tools (a lens, a scanner, a microphone) surrounds it, eager to begin processing."> | <img src="illustrations/mlkit_action.png" alt="Cinematic 3D render, animation movie style. The Worker Bees are in full action. The Oculist Bee projects a light beam extracting glowing text strings from the pollen. The Scanner Bee pulls out a barcode string. Other specialized bees perform their respective tasks, extracting various raw data fragments from the pollen. The data is still raw and disconnected."> | <img src="illustrations/mlkit_conclusion.png" alt="Cinematic 3D render, animation movie style.

| **The Raw Pollen:** An unstructured piece of information from the user's world arrives in the Hive, ready to be understood. | **The Specialists' Work:** The diverse Worker Bees (ML Kit) perform their fast, on-device extraction tasks, converting raw reality into digital fragments. | **The Prepared Ingredients:** The workers deliver the extracted, but still un-contextualized, data to the Queen for the crucial next stage of reasoning. |

### **2. The Bourdon: The Communicator & Occasional Tempter**

The Bourdon is the primary interface between the internal workings of the Hive and the Forager. He ensures the dialogue is engaging, presents quests, delivers the Queen's insights, and, true to his nature, occasionally offers tempting shortcuts.

*   **Function 1: Quest Delivery & Dialogue Initiation:** He verbally presents the Queen's quests and asks for clarification when needed.
*   **Function 2: The Hornet's Offer (Webview & AI Overview Extraction):**
    *   When the Forager captures pollen for a common entity (e.g., a well-known product), the Bourdon quickly activates a **WebView locally on the device**.
    *   He navigates this WebView to perform a Google Search query (e.g., `biere saison dupont dry hop; qu'est-ce que c'est et quelles sont ses fun facts et 4 questions a choix multiple avec reponse ?`).
    *   He then uses advanced on-device **ML Kit Text Recognition (OCR)** and **Entity Extraction** (if needed) to scrape and parse the visible "AI Overview" content and other relevant structured data from the WebView's HTML content.
    *   **Prompt to Gemma (via Bourdon's internal prompt):** The extracted "AI Overview" text, fun facts, and quiz questions are then passed to Gemma with a specific prompt (e.g., "Summarize this information in a friendly tone for a 10-year-old, extract key facts, and format the multiple-choice questions for a quiz, like a mémère would explain it").
    *   **Bourdon's Presentation:** The Bourdon uses the structured response from Gemma to present a concise, engaging, and often cheeky summary via TTS to the user, acting as a "distraction" while the Hive's main processing is underway. He then offers the quiz to keep Hiro engaged, subtly implying that this "easy" knowledge is quicker.
*   **Function 3: Managing User Choice:** He presents the user with the crucial choice: accept the Hornet's quick but opaque answer, or wait for the Queen's verified process.
*   **Function 4: Delivering Hive's Rewards:** He presents earned Honey Points and Badges.

The Bourdon, with a sly grin, hovers near Hiro's face (seen through the Great Bay Window). He holds a glowing, ephemeral digital 'AI Overview' as if it's a suspicious but enticing treat. His mouth is moving, delivering a tempting offer."> | <img src="illustrations/bourdon_conclusion.png" alt="Cinematic 3D render, animation movie style. The Bourdon leans back, satisfied, as Hiro makes his choice. If Hiro accepts the Hornet's data, a dull, grayed-out honeycomb appears. If Hiro chooses to forge, the Bourdon shrugs good-naturedly, ready for the next phase of the process."> |
| **The Tempter's Gaze:** The Bourdon, representing a shortcut to knowledge, observes the user's quest. | **The Sweet Offer:** He presents a tempting, instant answer from external cloud AI (an AI Overview), verbally delivered with a playful, testing tone. | **The Outcome:** The Bourdon reacts to the user's choice, confirming either quick, opaque knowledge or reinforcing the path of authentic discovery. |

### **3. The AI Queen: The Partner in Context and Meaning (Gemma)**

The AI Queen is the orchestrator, the true brain of the Hive. She uses a powerful Large Language Model (like Gemma) to understand the *meaning* and *relationships* between the data fragments. Crucially, she acts as a silent, wise partner, providing suggestions and learning from user feedback.

*   **Function 1: Suggesting Classification:** The Queen receives pure, extracted data from Worker Bees and **suggests** the most likely `schema.org` type for the entity, often with a confidence level.
*   **Function 2: Suggesting Data-to-Property Mapping:** Once the type is confirmed, the Queen **suggests** a mapping of the raw data to the correct properties of that schema.
*   **Function 3: Formulating Clarification Dialogues:** If data is ambiguous or her confidence is low, she formulates clear, simple questions for the Forager (relayed by the Bourdon).
*   **Function 4: Learning from Correction:** Every time the user corrects a suggestion, this feedback is used to fine-tune the Queen's future reasoning, making the partnership more effective over time.
