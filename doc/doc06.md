# Document 6/10: The Thread of Provenance - The Seal of Trust

**Title:** The Thread of Provenance: The Unbreakable Seal of Trust

**Objective:** To detail the structure, purpose, and in-game representation of the Provenance Document, establishing it as a core feature that guarantees transparency, verifiability, and trust in the data generated by Kikko.

---

### **Core Philosophy: The Story of the Honey**

In the world of Kikko, the "Informative Honey" (the structured JSON-LD data) is valuable. But its true power, its unassailable worth, comes from its story. The **Thread of Provenance** is that story. It is an immutable, human-readable, and machine-verifiable log of how a piece of knowledge came to be.

It is not metadata hidden in a menu; it is a **central feature**, a "Seal of Trust" that accompanies every single honeycomb cell in the user's Hive. It answers the fundamental questions of the Web 4.0 era: *Where does this information come from? How was it made? Can I trust it?*

### **1. The Structure of the "Thread of Provenance"**

The Thread of Provenance is a JSON file, bundled with the structured data and its raw pollen sources. It is composed of three main sections.

*   **A. The Hive's Identity (`hiveIdentity`):** This section identifies the "artisan" of the data.
    *   `hiveId`: A unique, locally generated identifier for the user's Kikko instance.
    *   `kikkoVersion`: The version of the application (e.g., "1.0.0").
    *   `activeSwarm`: An array listing the AI agents that participated.
        *   `queenAI`: `{ "name": "Gemma", "version": "2B-OnDevice-V1.2" }`
        *   `workerBees`: `[ { "role": "Oculist", "name": "ML Kit Text Recognition", "version": "18.0.2" }, { ... } ]`

*   **B. The Foraging Chronicle (`pollenChronicle`):** A timestamped log of every piece of raw data contributed by the user.
    *   An array of "pollen" objects:
        *   `{ "timestamp": "...", "pollenType": "Visual", "source": "forager_camera", "reference": "pollen/image_001.jpg" }`
        *   `{ "timestamp": "...", "pollenType": "Auditory", "source": "forager_microphone", "data": { "transcription": "Tastes like cherries..." }, "reference": "pollen/audio_001.wav" }`

*   **C. The Queen's Deliberations (`queenDeliberations`):** A log of the key reasoning steps taken by the AI Queen. This is the most crucial part for transparency.
    *   An array of "inference" steps:
        *   `{ "timestamp": "...", "action": "Entity Classification", "input": ["raw text from OCR", "barcode data"], "output": "{ 'identifiedType': 'schema:Wine' }", "confidence": 0.95 }`
        *   `{ "timestamp": "...", "action": "Property Mapping", "input": ["name: ?", "alcoholPercentage: ?"], "evidence": ["Château La Pompe", "13% vol."], "output": "{ 'name': 'Château La Pompe', 'alcoholPercentage': '13' }" }`
        *   `{ "timestamp": "...", "action": "Clarification Request", "promptToUser": "Does '12/25' refer to a date or a vintage?", "userResponsePollenRef": "pollen/audio_002.wav" }`

| **The Seal of Trust:** Every piece of knowledge created is automatically stamped with a seal, signifying that its history is recorded. | **Unfolding the Story:** The user can inspect the seal at any time, revealing the entire creation process in a simple, visual, and understandable way. | **The Trusted Package:** The final data and its provenance are intrinsically linked, creating a single, verifiable unit of knowledge ready for use or sharing. |

### **2. The Role in Gameplay: Defeating the Daemons**

The Thread of Provenance is not just a log file; it's a core game mechanic.

*   **Shield Against Glitch Hornets:** When a "corrupted pollen" alert is triggered, the Queen can explain *why* it's suspicious by showing a flawed provenance trail: `"Warning: This pollen source has no verifiable origin or has been flagged by other Hives."`
*   **Antidote to the Weaver Sphinx:** The offer from the Weaver Sphinx would explicitly state that accepting means forfeiting the personal Thread of Provenance for a centralized, opaque one. The value of keeping the thread becomes a clear gameplay choice.
*   **Weapon Against Rust Scarabs:** The "Restoration Quest" is literally a mission to repair a damaged Thread of Provenance. The game loop involves revisiting the original pollen sources to re-validate the chain of trust, making the player an active participant in data maintenance.

### **3. The Impact on Sharing: The Birth of Verifiable Knowledge**

When a user shares a "honey pot" via WebTorrent, they are sharing the complete package: the data, the provenance, and the raw pollen.

*   **Empowering the Recipient:** The friend who receives the data for "Château La Pompe" doesn't just get a recommendation. They can unroll the Thread of Provenance and see the original photo of the bottle Hiro scanned, hear his original voice note about its taste, and see how the AI interpreted it. This creates an unparalleled level of trust and richness.
*   **A New Standard for Data:** This sets a new standard for information. We move from a world of "black box" data, where we must trust the source blindly, to a world of **"glass box" data**, where the process is as important as the result.
*   **Enabling a Resilient Web of Trust:** As these trusted packages are shared, they form a decentralized web of verifiable knowledge. Any node in the network can independently audit and confirm the integrity of the information, building a collective intelligence that is resistant to censorship and corruption.

**Conclusion:**
The Thread of Provenance is Kikko's soul. It elevates the application from a clever data-capture tool to a pioneering platform for trustworthy, personal, and shareable knowledge. It gives the Forager not only the power to remember, but the confidence to know that their memories are pure, their history is intact, and their knowledge is real.
