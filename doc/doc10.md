# Document 10/10: The Kikko Project - Synopsis for the Google AI Edge Challenge

**Title:** Kikko: Your Personal Memory Hive - A Personal Knowledge Game Built on Trust

**Objective:** To provide a comprehensive summary of the Kikko project for the Google AI Edge Challenge, highlighting its innovative concept, its sophisticated use of Google's on-device AI to tackle a modern-day dilemma, and its profound potential for real-world impact.

---

### **1. High-Concept Pitch**

In an age where AI offers instant but opaque answers, **Kikko** introduces a new genre: the **Personal Knowledge Game**. It reframes the smartphone not as a window to the cloud, but as a private, intelligent **Memory Hive** that helps you build a rich, verifiable graph of your own life. Kikko transforms data collection into a gamified "foraging" quest, where you (the **Forager**) and your on-device AI partners—the wise **AI Queen (Gemma)** and her diligent **Worker Bees (ML Kit)**, guided by the witty **Bourdon**—collaborate to turn personal experiences into **trusted knowledge**. It poses a central question for our time: do you accept the quick, easy answer from the cloud, or do you forge your own, verifiable truth?

### **2. The Vision & Impact (40 Points)**

Kikko's vision is to empower individuals with **sovereignty over their digital memory** in the age of generative AI.

*   **Tackling a Modern Dilemma: The Hornet's Temptation.** Kikko directly addresses the "convenience vs. truth" problem. It gamifies the choice between accepting opaque, pre-packaged "AI Overviews" from external cloud sources (the "Hornet's Offer") and the rewarding effort of forging personal, verifiable knowledge. This subtly educates users on digital literacy and the critical importance of provenance.
*   **A New Paradigm for Personal AI: Human-AI Partnership.** Kikko models a **true human-AI partnership**. The AI Queen (Gemma) suggests, guides, and reasons, but the user (the Forager) provides the raw input and the final validation. The Bourdon acts as the charming, often cheeky, communicator, bridging the gap between the Hive's processing and the user's perception. This collaborative approach builds trust and keeps the user in absolute control.
*   **Radical Privacy & Trust:** With a **100% on-device architecture**, all user data (pollen, honey, AI models, and inferences) remains within the user's private device. The "Thread of Provenance" for every user-created memory is an auditable, locally generated log, ensuring unparalleled transparency and trustworthiness.
*   **A Gift to the Community: Non-Commercial Vision.** Kikko is a **non-commercial project**, offered entirely free. Its sole focus is on impact and demonstrating a viable, ethical model for personal AI. By being accessible to all, it aims to spark a global conversation about data sovereignty and responsible technology.

### **3. Technical Depth & Execution (30 Points & Google AI Edge Prize)**

Kikko is a sophisticated showcase of how Google's on-device technologies can be orchestrated to create a novel, privacy-first experience.

*   **The AI Queen (Gemma - The Partner):** At the heart of the Hive is **Gemma**, leveraged for its powerful on-device reasoning. The Queen acts not as an oracle, but as a collaborative partner:
    1.  **Suggestion Engine:** It suggests `schema.org` classifications (e.g., `gs1:Beverage`, `schema:Book`) and maps extracted data to properties.
    2.  **Dialogue Generation:** It formulates natural language questions for the Bourdon to relay to the user for clarification (e.g., for ambiguous dates or missing crucial details).
    3.  **Complex Structuring:** It structures nested data types (e.g., `PostalAddress`, `ContactPoint`) and understands relationships between different pieces of pollen.
    4.  **Personalized Knowledge Graphing:** It dynamically builds and analyzes the user's growing personal memory graph to provide meaningful insights.

*   **The Worker Bees (ML Kit - The Specialists):** A comprehensive suite of **ML Kit** APIs acts as our specialized "Worker Bees" for fast, efficient, on-device data extraction from the real world. Their diverse capabilities are crucial for transforming raw pollen into structured inputs for Gemma:
    *   **Vision:**
        *   **Text Recognition v2 (OCR):** Extracts characters from complex layouts (labels, documents, signs) in multiple languages.
        *   **Barcode Scanning:** Decodes 1D and 2D barcodes (GTINs, QR codes).
        *   **Document Scanner (Beta):** Enhances photo capture of documents for optimal text processing.
        *   **Image Labeling (Base & Custom Models):** Identifies objects and concepts within images.
        *   **Object Detection & Tracking:** Identifies and tracks multiple objects in real-time.
        *   **Digital Ink Recognition:** Converts handwritten notes to digital text.
        *   *(Future Potential for Enhanced Contextual Foraging):* Face Detection/Mesh, Pose Detection, Selfie Segmentation, Subject Segmentation could be used to add richer context about *who* was present, *what* body language was expressed, or *where* an interaction took place.
    *   **Natural Language:**
        *   **Language Identification:** Determines language of text/speech.
        *   **Translation:** Used for internal schema localization and potential future user-initiated translation of foraged text.
        *   **Entity Extraction (Beta):** Identifies and tags entities (names, dates, addresses) in text.
        *   **Summarization (Beta):** Potentially used for abstracting long text inputs into key insights.
        *   **Proofreading (Beta) / Rewriting (Beta):** Could be used for internal text refinement or user-requested style changes of text inputs.

*   **The Bourdon (The Communicator & The Hornet's Messenger):** This unique AI agent manages the interactive dialogue and presents the core dilemma.
    1.  **Dialogue Orchestration:** Relays Queen's quests and suggestions via TTS.
    2.  **Hornet's Offer Delivery:** Activates a local **WebView** to perform a Google Search query (e.g., `biere saison dupont dry hop; what is it and fun facts?`). It then uses **ML Kit's OCR and Entity Extraction** to scrape and parse the "AI Overview" and other structured data from the WebView's HTML. This processed "Hornet's Pollen" is then presented to the user via TTS (voiced by the Bourdon) with a quiz, engaging the user while the Queen works on the pure pollen.
    3.  **Choice Presentation:** Presents the user with the crucial choice: accept the Hornet's quick, opaque answer, or wait for the Queen's verified, pure honey.

*   **The Architecture of Trust:**
    *   **Core App:** Built on Android (Kotlin) ensuring deep integration with device capabilities.
    *   **On-Device Database:** A comprehensive `SQLite` database stores schemas (Schema.org, GS1, including custom Google Rich Result properties) and the user's personal knowledge graph.
    *   **Immersive UI:** A `WebView` serves as the "Great Bay Window," rendering the gamified UI and allowing for rapid iteration of the visual experience. A native `JSInterface` provides a secure bridge for the UI to access the on-device AI services and database.
    *   **Decentralized Sharing:** **WebTorrent** is integrated for secure, private, peer-to-peer sharing of "Trusted Packages" (data + provenance).
